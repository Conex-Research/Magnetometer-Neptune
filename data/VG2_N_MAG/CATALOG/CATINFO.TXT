This directory contains metadata associated with this volume. This           
information is divided into a series of separate template files. These       
include the files MISSION.CAT, describing the Voyager mission, INSTHOST.CAT, 
describing the Voyager spacecraft, *INST.CAT file, describing the Voyager    
instrument, *DS.CAT file, describing the data set contained on               
this volume, PERSON.CAT file listing contact information for personnel       
associated with one of the Voyager data sets, and a REF.CAT which            
describes references related to the Voyager mission, spacecraft or one of    
the individual instruments or data sets.                                     
                                                                             
These files were prepared specifically for the PDS Data Set Catalog          
maintained by the PDS Central Node (see link at http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/).
