Abstract. The Voyager Project, managed by the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, involves the lauching of two advanced spacecraft to
explore the Jovian and Saturnian systems, as well as interplanetary
space. The one-month lauch period opens on August 20, 1977 with
arrivals at Jupiter in March and July of 1979, and at Saturn in
November of 1980 and August of 1981. Gravity-assist swingbys of
Jupiter are utilized in order to reduce the lauch energy demands
needed to reach Saturn. In addition, a gravity-assist targeting option
at Saturn will be maintained on the second-arriving Voyager for a
possible continuation on to Uranus, with arrival in January of 1986.
Flight through the Jovian and Saturnian systems will achieve close to
moderate flyby encounter with several of the natural satellites,
including special flyby geometry conditions for Io and Titan, as well
as an Earth occultation of the spacecraft's radio signal by the rings
of Saturn. The purpose of this paper us to describe the Voyager
mission characteristics in order to establish a framework upon which
to better understand the objectives and goals of the eleven scientific
investigations which are described in subsequent papers.

1. Introduction

During the late 1970's, alignment of the outer planets affords a
variety of multi-planet launch opportunities. From the standpoint of
Jupiter flyby distance, the 1977 oportunity (Bourke et al., 1972;
Schurmeier, 1974) is the most favorable for reaching Saturn via a
gravity-assist swingby of Jupiter. Two advanced spacecraft will be
lauched during a one-month lauch period which opens on August 20,
1977. Each spacecraft will be launched by a Titan IIIE/Centaur D-IT
from Launch Complex 41 at the Air Force Eastern Test Range. Final
Earth-departure injection velocity will be delivered by a solid rocket
portion of each spacecraft. After solid rocket burnout and jettison,
the remainder of each spacecraft, having a mass of approximately 825
kg, begins its cruise to Jupiter.

As shown in Figure 1, each spacecraft will perform a flyby mission
through the Jovian and Saturnian systems, including close to moderate
flybys of several satellites. Among the satellite encounters, Titan,
Io, and Ganymede command the highest priority. Planetary observations
and environmental measurements with the Voyager scientific instruments
are productive over extended time periods, starting two to three
months before planetary encounter and ending about one month after
encounter. Measurement sequences are particularly intense during the
last day containing planetary encounter, when satellite observations
are possible at reduced ranges and when the rapidly changing planetary
viewing geometry and greater fields-and-particles effects occur. A
variety of science data rates are available during the mission, and
range from several hundred bits/sec at S-band frequency during cruise
to 115.2 kilobits/sec at X-band frequency during most of the Jupiter
encounter periods.

The remainder of this paper describes the overall mission and science
objectives, the spacecraft capabilities, the trajectory design
characteristics, the navigation performance, and selected features of
the science observations and measurement sequences. Numerous mission
design tradeoffs (Kohlhase, 1977) were necessary to enable selection
of a perferred pair of trajectories out of the huge number of possible
candidates (Beerer et al., 1973; Penzo, 1974). A discussion of this
selection process will not be presented in this paper in order to
allow more time to describe the characteristics of the nominal mission
that resulted from the selection process.

2. Mission Objectives

The Voyager mission objectives are to conduct exploratory
investigations of the Jupiter and Saturn planetary systems and of the
interplanetary medium from Earth to Saturn. Primary emphasis will be
placed on comparative studies of the two systems, including their
environments, atmospheres, and body characteristics. Special
trajectory targeting will allow detailed investigations of one or more
satellites of each planet, including Io and Titan, and of the rings of
Saturn. In addition, a Uranus option possibility is being maintained
on the second-arriving spacecraft at Saturn, but would only be
considered if the first-arriving spacecraft had first secured the key
Saturn-related science objectives and if the second-arriving
spacecraft was judged to have adequate expendables and operational
health to undertake the additional four years of flight from Saturn to
Uranus. The large complement of scientific instruments aboard each
Voyager allows the investigation of particles and fields as well as
broad coverage of the electromagnetic spectrum. Table I lists the
instrument teams together with their Principal Investigator and major
experiment objectives. The teams themselves directly involve nearly
100 science investigators.

Jupiter, with 13 known satellites, and Saturn, with 10 known
satellites and unique rings, provide many targets of interest (Table
II); certainly too many to investigate at close range for the two
Jupiter and two Saturn planetary flybys available with this mission.
Thus, very early in the mission design, the Science Steering Group
(SSG, composed of the Principle Investigators and chaired by E. C.
Stone of Caltech) decided that, in addition to the planets themselves,
emphasis should be given to the Galilean satellites, particularly Io
and Ganymede, and to Titan and Saturn's rings. In summary, the major
objectives (not prioritized) are to investigate:
(a) The Jupiter and Saturn gravitational fields and satellite masses,
(b) the dynamics of the Jupiter and Saturn atmospheres,
(c) the Jupiter and Saturn magnetospheres, i.e., the magnetic fields
and
charged particle environments and wave particle interactions,
(d) the interaction of the satellites with these media, particularly
Io,
(e) the energy balance of Jupiter and Saturn,
(f) the atmospheres, surface composition and features of Titan, the
Galilean satellites, and other satellites, as available,
(g) Jupiter's Great Red Spot,
(h) Saturn's rings,
(i) the interplanetary and interstellar media, and
(j) the Uranus planetary system, should conditions allow the option to
be
exercised.

It is primarily these objectives that determine the nature of the
planetary flybys. Several of these objectives are related to the
planets and to the planetary and interplanetary media and can be met
simply by achieving a moderately close flyby of the planets, say 5-10
planetary radii, and are independent of the time of arrival at the
planet, the approach distance, and the trajectory inclination. Other
objectives, particularly those for the satellites and the rings, are
quite dependent upon the arrival time, distance, and orbit
inclination. Based upon these science objectives, and the ability to
shape the flybys of Jupiter and Saturn, it is possible to provide the
following characteristics for the Voyager trajectories:
(a) Earth and Sun occultations of Jupiter and Saturn on both
trajectories,
(b) passage through the Io flux tube (defined in Figure 2) at a
distance of
about 20 000 km,
(c) close to moderate encounters with Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto
(50
000-250 000 km),
(d) passage through the Callisto Earth and Sun occultation regions on
selected launch days,
(e) close encounter with Titan (5000-15 000 km) including Earth and
Sun
occultations and wake passage,
(f) close to moderate encounters with several of Saturn's satellites,
(g) occultation of the Earth by all of Saturn's rings.

At Jupiter, it is not possible to provide all of these characteristics
with a single flyby. Therefore, the trajectories for each Voyager have
been designed to be complementary. For example, an Io flux tube
passage is planned for the first-arriving spacecraft, and a Ganymede
close encounter or a Callisto Earth and Sun occultation is planned for
the second-arriving spacecraft. The two nominal trajectories are also
well designed in the event that one spacecraft should not reach
Jupiter, since each trajectory has good encounters with three of the
four Galilean satellites. At Saturn, a close Titan encounter with
Earth and Sun occultations is possible on both trajectories, with the
Titan encounter occurring three-quarters of a day prior to Saturn
periapsis passage. The capability also exists on both trajectories to
achieve acceptable ring occulations by the Earth. There are two
reasons for this redundancy. The first is that, if Voyager I fails
prior to arriving at Saturn, then Voyager 2 can still realize the best
overall science of the Saturnian system. The second reason is that, in
the event that Voyager I successfully completes its planned
objectives, then Voyager 2 can be flown past Saturn through a gravity-
assist corridor so that it may continue on to the planet Uranus. It
should be noted that, if the Uranus option is selected, the Saturn
flyby cannot provide a close encounter with Titan, nor a ring
occulation by the Earth. But the Uranus option would only be exercised
if these key objectives had already been secured by Voyager 1.

3. Spacecraft Description

The use of a Voyager spacecraft (Draper et al., 1975), with its
greater amount of power, onboard computer capability, and precision
pointing, permits the use of remote sensing instrumentation which is
more sophisticated than that of the Pioneer spin-stabilized spacecraft
(Fimmel et al., 1976). As shown in Figures 3 and 4, instruments to
support eleven scientific investigations will be carried aboard each
spacecraft. The science payload mass is approximately 105 kg and
consumes 90 W for electronics and 10 W for heating. Included are
medium and high resolution television cameras, spectrometers and
photometric instruments for atmospheric and other analyses, radio
receivers to measure planetary ratio emissions and plasma waves,
numerous sensors to measure fields and charge particles, and a high
precision Earth/spacecraft radio link for communication, navigation,
and science purposes. Visual surveys, spectral scans, temperature
measurements, mass and size determinations, and radio probing of
possible ionospheres and atmospheres will be performed. The narrow-
angle television camera will also be used for extremely precise
navigation (Duxbury et al., 1974) during planetary approach by
permitting calculation of the spacecraft trajectory based upon
pictures of the planetary satellites against a star background.

In order to remain functional for the nearly four-year journey to
Saturn, the Voyager subsystems have been designed with high
reliability components and extensive redundancy. In addition, an
onboard computer provides for selected fault detection and corrective
action to place the spacecraft in a safe state for ground based
follow-up. As a result of the severe Jupiter radiation environment
measured by the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft (Fimmel et al., 1976),
appropriate radiation hardening, parts selection, circuit design
evaluation, and shielding actions were taken to strengthen the Voyager
resistance to radiation effects.

Because of the great distance of Saturn from the Sun, it is no longer
practical to use solar cells. Instead, plutonium-oxide-fueled
radioisotope thermoelectric generators are used to convert 7200 W of
heat to the nearly 390 W of electrical power needed during Saturn
encounter. During cruise, attitude control electronics utilize Sun and
star tracker error signals to maintain three-axis orientation by
firing small thrusters. An integrated hot gas (monopropellant
hydrazine) propulsion subsystem with sixteen small thrusters is used
for both attitude control and trajectory correction maneuvers.
Precision pointing of the scan platform is possible under both
celestial and inertial attitude control modes.

The science boom provides mounting for the science scan platform and,
inboard of the platform, the Low Energy Charged Particle, Cosmic Ray,
and Plasma instruments. The two-degree-of-freedom scan platform
supports the Ultraviolet Spectrometer, Infrared Interferometer
Spectrometer and Radiometer, Photopolarimeter, and the wide and
narrow-angle cameras and control electronics of the Imaging Science
Subsystem. A Brewster plate is mounted on the bus for polarimetric
calibration of the Photopolarimeter, and a diffuse calibration target
for scan platform instruments is positioned on the back side of the
shunt radiator assembly of the power subsystem.

Uplink communications use an S-band link at 2115 MHz and can be
received over the spacecraft LGA or HGA. Downlink communications can
be at 2295 MHz S-band over the LGA or HGA, or at 8415 MHz X-band over
the HGA. Telemetry is collected by the Flight Data Subsystem (FDS),
formatted, and routed to the Modulation Demodulation Subsystem (MDS)
for impression on the rf carrier, or to the Digital Tape Recorder
(DTR) for later playback. The four basic types of telemetry data
consist of engineering only, cruise science plus engineering,
encounter general science plus engineering (GS & E), and imaging plus
GS & E. Table III summarizes the FDS data modes, contents, and data
rates. In general, data rates of 2560 bps or less are returned at S-
band frequency, and data rates from 7.2 to 115.2 Kbps are returned at
X-band frequency. Science data are digitized within each instrument
subsystem and presented to the FDS for formatting.

Science data return rates can range from a maximum of 115.2 Kbps down
to as little as a few tens of bits/sec, depending upon the
configuration of the telecommunications system. Link performance is
governed by such configuration parameters as S-band vs X-band
frequency, 26 m vs 64 m Deep Space Station (DSS) receiving antenna
diameter, spacecraft transmitter low vs high-power mode (from 6 to 28
W), and Earth-to-spacecraft range. In addition, performance at X-band
is particularly sensitive to the amount of moisture in the path of the
radio signal. Since weather is probabilistic in-nature, even given the
seasonal and diurnal conditions, it is not possible to state
deterministically the performance at X-band. As a general rule,
however, the poorest X-band performance is expected to occur during
the low elevation angle overlap between the DSS-43 (Australia) and
DSS-63 (Spain)tracking stations, while the best performance is
expected near the center of the DSS-14 (California) tracking pass. In
order to envelope the data rate performance anticipated through the
mission, Figure 5 has been constructed to show both the conservative
and the optimistic performance boundaries for the JSX trajectory. The
actual operating point will fall inside the boundaries shown, but a
more comprehensive assessment is beyond the scope of this paper. Data
rate performance for the earlier arriving JST trajectory is
considerably better at Jupiter encounter due to the reduced Earth
Jupiter range.

Finally, the spacecraft Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem
(AACS) and the Computer Command Subsystem (CCS) each play a key role
in determining the science pointing and instrument sequencing
capabilities. In addition to providing three-axis attitude control,
the AACS provides articulation of the science scan platform about
azimuth and elevation axes. Available slewing rates about each axis
are 0.096 mr/sec (very low rate), 1.45 mr/sec (terminal rate), 5.82
mr/sec (low rate), and 17.45 mr/sec (high rate). Settling times from
the end of each slew until reaching an effective rate of 20
[micro]r/sec can range from 30 sec (1.45 mr/sec slew) to 170 sec
(17.45 mr/sec slew). Platform pointing control of 2.5 mr per axis,
3[sigma], is expected relative to celestial references, with a
platform pointing knowledge from telemetry data of 1.5 mr per axis,
3[sigma]. Control of the spacecraft is normally accomplished by
onboard commands issued by the CCS in response to stored program
instructions. The CCS contains two identical nonvolatile 4096 word by
18 bit memories within each of which about 2810 words are for fixed
spacecraft routines, leaving about 1286 words for science sequencing
functions. The total length of time for which one CCS sequencing
memory load can continue to operate the science related functions
obviously depends upon the science activity level. Time durations
range from as long as 28 days cruise to slightly less than one day
during the high-activity period near planetary closest approach.

4. Trajectory Design

Two Voyager spacecraft will be launched during a one-month launch
opportunity which opens on August 20, 1977. This opportunity discussed
by Bourke et al. (1972) and Schurmeier (1974), was originally
identified with a special alignment of the outer planets allowing a
spacecraft to use multiple gravity assists to go from Jupiter to
Saturn, then to Uranus, and finally to Neptune, assuming that the
appropriate inflight navigation trajectory corrections are applied.
The unique Jupiter and Saturn alignment, which is being used in the
1977 mission, will not occur again until 1997. Although a 1978 launch
is possible, launch in 1977 is optimum for investigation of Jupiter
and the Galilean satellites.

The requirement for the trajectory to continue on to Saturn limits the
design of the Jupiter encounter. Specifically, the trajectory must
remain close to the ecliptic plane resulting in possible inclinations
to Jupiter's equator of 6-10 deg. The arrival date at Jupiter can be
varied, with the result that the distance of closest approach to each
of the Galilean satellites will vary. Thus, there will exist a unique
arrival time for each satellite, and each orbit of that satellite. The
Jupiter arrival times for these closest satellite approaches, in
addition to the times for satellite flux tube passages, wake passages,
and Sun and Earth occulations, have been computed for the available
span of Jupiter arrival dates. The existence and characteristics of
these events will also vary with the Earth launch date.

At Saturn, the flyby conditions will be unrestricted, unless the
spacecraft is to continue on to Uranus, in which case the trajectory
will be constrained to remain close to the ecliptic plane. Here the
mission objectives of achieving an Earth and Sun occultation of the
rings, and a close encounter with Titan, are the main considerations
that shape the flyby trajectory. Concern that Saturn's rings may
extend considerably beyond the A ring and impose a possible hazard to
the spacecraft (Michaux, 1975), as well as the possibility of a non-
negligible Saturn radiation environment, motivates the choice of
encountering Titan before rather than after arriving at Saturn and the
rings. In addition, the trajectory is designed to include occultations
of the Earth and Sun by Titan and a passage through Titan's wake.

A final design consideration requires selecting a particular location
of Titan in its orbit so that the post-Titan trajectory will achieve
an acceptable occultation of the Earth by all of the rings of Saturn,
as needed by the Ratio Science Team. Unlike the Jupiter trajectory
design, the design at Saturn is essentially independent of the Earth
launch date.

The accomplishment of these objectives at Saturn will require precise
timing, on the order of tens of minutes. Thus, the planned arrival
time at Saturn is nearly fixed, at least for each orbit of Titan. At
Jupiter, satisfying the Galilean satellite objectives also requires
precise timing. One property of ballistic gravity-assist trajectories
is that fixing the launch date and the time of arrival at one other
planet, say Saturn, will determine the arrival time at the
intermediate planet, in this case Jupiter. Some variation in timing
can be achieved with the use of propulsion, and significant propulsion
is planned to be used after the Jupiter encounter to achieve the
proper timing at Saturn. Thus, to a limited extent, favorable timing
conditions at Jupiter can be matched with the desired Titan encounter
timing at Saturn.

Satisfying the timing requirements at Jupiter and Saturn does not
imply that all science objectives can be met on a single Voyager
trajectory. In particular, early arrivals at Jupiter, no later than
April 4, 1979, are required for close encounter with Io and passage
through the Io flux tube. Later arrivals place Jupiter closest
approach distances beyond Io's orbit. On the other hand, later
arrivals at Saturn, and hence Jupiter (after June 15, 1979), are
needed to maintain the Uranus option and remain outside the visible
rings during the Saturn gravity-assist flyby. Earlier arrivals at
Saturn would require passage through the visible rings to continue on
the Uranus. Thus, the Voyager trajectory space divides into two
distinct sets: that which can provide a close Io encounter, and that
which can maintain the Uranus options without requiring a passage
through the visible rings at Saturn. This latter set, since it
requires more distance passages at Jupiter (greater than 8.6 Jupiter
radii), may be considered to be more conservative in the sense that
the spacecraft would receive a lesser radiation dose during the Jovian
flyby. The Io encounter set comes appreciably closer to Jupiter (4.5
to 6.0 Jupiter radii); however, the Voyager spacecraft have been
designed to have a good probability of withstanding the higher
radiation doses estimated for these closer Jovian flybys.

Each set contains several possible trajectories (10 to 20) for each
launch date. For the Io encounter set, trajectory differences at
Jupiter would involve how closely Io and other Galilean satellites are
encountered. For the Uranus option set, with the primary Galilean
satellite being Ganymede or Callisto, the differences would be in
their flyby characteristics in addition to the encounter distances to
the other Galilean satellites. At Saturn, with both sets providing the
desired Titan characteristics, the differences would be the approach
distances to the other Saturnian satellites, as well as the quality of
the Earth occultation by the rings.

Presented with data describing the trajectory characteristics of these
two sets, the SSG and the Project have chosen those candidates which
became part of the overall launch strategy. This strategy identifies
the trajectory which will be chosen for each launch day and, since
there are two launches, the choice for the second will depend upon
when the first is launched, and its success or failure. No attempt
will be made here to describe the launch strategy and the trajectory
choices on a day-by-day basis throughout the one-month launch
opportunity. Instead, detailed descriptions will be given of the two
nominal trajectories which have the highest probabilities of being
flown. Thus, for the launch strategy developed, the first launch will
be August 20 on a Uranus option trajectory. It has been designed JSX,
where the X may be replaced by U if the Uranus option is exercised, or
by T if a close Titan encounter is chosen. The second launch is
planned for September 1 on an Io-intensive trajectory and is called
JST, where the T stands for Titan. The JST trajectory, as discussed
earlier, will arrive at Saturn first and will not have the option to
go to Uranus. The Voyager I spacecraft will fly the JST trajectory,
and Voyager 2 will fly the JSX trajectory.

Table IV summarizes the major characteristics of the JSX and JST
nominal trajectories. Figure 6 shows the heliocentric view of the
trajectories, and Figures 7-10 illustrate the Jovian and Saturnian
encounters. At Jupiter, close to moderate encounters (22 000 to 201
000 km) with all the Galilean satellites will be obtained. For the
narrow angle imaging system, this implies a resolution of 4 km or
better. In addition, Table IV indicates that Ganymede and Callisto are
encountered before Jupiter on JSX and after Jupiter on JST. Thus,
assuming that the satellites are in synchronous rotation like Earth's
moon, these satellites will present different faces to Voyager on each
encounter. The closest Galilean encounters are for Io on JST (22 000
km) which includes a passage through the Io flux tube, and for
Ganymede on JSX (55 000 km).

At Saturn, the JST trajectory will arrive first and encounter Titan 18
hr before Saturn. The Titan flyby has been shaped to have a close
encounter distance of 7000 km followed by Earth and Sun occultations
by Titan. This encounter distance has been chosen to allow the closest
possible approach to Titan without causing the navigation errors and
Titan perturbation uncertainties to jeopardize subsequent satellite
viewing from pre-stored pointing sequences. Other satellites
encountered within 200 000 km are Mimas, Dione, and Rhea. Finally,
Figure 11 illustrates the JST trajectory as seen from Earth, showing
entry and exit occultations of Saturn's atmosphere, as well as an
outbound occultation of Saturn's rings following a brief planet-ring
gap passage period.

The JSX trajectory, which will arrive at Saturn nine months after JST,
can continue on to Uranus, assuming a successful JST encounter at
Saturn. This JSX option will not encounter Titan closely nor provide
an Earth occultation by the rings. It will provide, however,
encounters of less than 200 000 km with Tethys, Enceladus, Mimas, and
Dione. If the Uranus option is not chosen, then the Titan encounter
will be retargeted for a 15 000 km closest approach distance together
with Earth and Sun occultations. Past Saturn, as shown in Figure 6,
both trajectories head in the general direction of the solar apex at a
rate of about 3 AU per year.

5. Navigation Capabilities

The navigation function employs a combination of radiometric tracking
data, approach optical data, and a priori ephemeris knowledge,
together with the spacecraft trajectory correction capability, to
direct the Voyagers onto the desired flyby trajectories, and to
provide knowledge of the actual trajectories achieved. The navigation
process (Hildebrand et al., 1973; Jacobson et al., 1976; McKinley et
al., 1976) is complex and will not be described in this summary paper.
However, the estimated navigation accuracy capabilities are very
relevant to the science objectives of delivering the instrument
fields-of-view to the desired target areas.

In order to understand the navigation language as related to the
Voyager requirements, it is first necessary to define a few key terms.
'Global' navigation, using primarily the proven radiometric tracking
system, has been assumed in meeting basic trajectory control functions
which enable the spacecraft to proceed from Earth to Jupiter, and on
to Saturn, while performing planet-oriented science measurements
during the encounter periods. 'Local' navigation, using both
radiometric and optical data, has been assumed in meeting the full
satellite-oriented science measurements. Two subcategories, 'delivery'
and 'knowledge', distinguish between those requirements which must be
met at the time of the last pre-planet trajectory correction maneuver,
and those requirements which must be met just prior to the final
science sequence update for orientation/pointing control during the
near-encounter period. Finally, trajectory 'reconstruction' assumes
the use of all data types to obtain a final estimate of the spacecraft
trajectory and target viewing directions for use in the detailed
analysis and interpretation of the science data after the encounter.

Navigation requirements have been established for several different
mission functions, the most important of which fall into the following
categories: reaching the final destination within available [DELTA]V
(hydrazine) reserves; honoring planetary and satellite impact-
avoidance quarantine constraints; delivering the spacecraft to
satellite-relative target zones such as occultation, flux tube, or
wake regions; controlling the Saturn ring gap delivery for the RSS
occultation experiment; estimating the near-encounter trajectory with
sufficient accuracy to point the scan platform at selected targets
within allowable tolerances; and providing a post-encounter orbit
reconstruction accuracy of sufficient quality to support the final
analysis and interpretation of the science data. Table V provides a
summary of the major navigation accuracy capability estimates,
expressed in terms of the 1 [sigma] semi-major axis of the total
navigator error ellipsoid. Performance of the navigational system at
these levels will meet most of the presently known mission accuracy
requirements.

6. Observation Sequences

All science instruments will be turned on and will be operational
shortly after injection from Earth orbit. Since the Earth and Moon
provide many characteristics which may be expected for Jupiter,
Saturn, and their satellites, observations useful for instrument
calibrations can be made and are planned during the first week after
launch. Also, star fields will be imaged for scan platform calibration
in addition to other engineering calibrations and tests to ensure that
each spacecraft is operating properly. The first trajectory correction
maneuver is performed about six days after launch for the purpose of
correcting launch vehicle and spacecraft solid rocket injection
errors.

The cruise phase officially begins 30 days after launch and continues
until 80 days before Jupiter encounter. This period provides the
fields and particles instruments the opportunity to investigate the
Earth-to-Jupiter interplanetary region. Engineering activities include
scan platform, antenna, and celestial sensor calibrations, in addition
to the required navigation activities. A major science activity,
lasting about 20 hours and requiring many yaw and roll maneuvers, will
be performed once every two months on each spacecraft to permit the
UVS and PPS instruments to map the celestial sphere, and to allow the
fields and particles instruments to perform calibrations, The ISS and
IRIS instruments also perform calibrations by looking at celestial
bodies, or by looking at the calibration plate attached to the
spacecraft.

At Jupiter encounter minus 80 days, observations of Jupiter and the
Galilean satellites begin. At this time, periodic X-band radio
tracking over the 64 m net becomes available and provides the higher
data rate required for return of recorded imaging data. The ISS narrow
angle camera can obtain Earth-based resolution or better, and will
take color images every two hours. Other optical instruments will also
be observing Jupiter, as well as the Galilean satellites and their
surrounding environments. Figure 12 presents a simplified timeline
showing the major science activities to be performed during the
observatory phase, as well as during the succeeding encounter phases.
At about minus 34 days on JST, when ISS begins frequent imagining of
Jupiter in a systematic manner so that a movie simulation of cloud
motions may be obtained, the spacecraft will receive full time X-band
coverage from the 64 m net.

Full time X-band coverage is required in the far-encounter phase
(Jupiter encounter minus 30 days to encounter minus 1 day) to support
the high-rate fields and particles measurements, as well as imaging
and optical navigation. The science observations are interrupted at
encounter minus 12 days for the final pre-Jupiter trajectory
correction maneuver.

The near-encounter phase includes the Jupiter encounter +/- 1 day and
is the highest activity period for Jupiter science. On the approach to
Jupiter, spectral instrument viewing will include north-south and
constant latitude scans, Great Red Spot mosaics, such as in Figure 13,
and viewing of special features on Jupiter such as hot spots, which
are locations on Jupiter with higher temperatures than their
surroundings. Closer in, observations will be made of Jupiter's bright
limb, terminator, dark limb, and dark side. Past perijove, Earth and
solar occultations of the spacecraft provide radio and optical
penetration deep into Jupiter's atmosphere. During the occulations,
the spacecraft will be under inertial attitude control instead of the
celestial control it maintains during the majority of the mission.
Being on gyros will permit the spacecraft to roll to an optimum
orientation for UVS observation of the solar occultation, and to
maneuver to point the High Gain Antenna to track the virtual image of
the Earth on the planet's limb during the Earth occultation.

Each Voyager spacecraft is within the Galilean satellite system during
the entire near-encounter phase, and a large fraction of the time is
spent viewing these bodies From a distance, observations can be made
of bright limbs, and terminators, and at various phase angles. At
closest approach to the satellites, imaging mosaics of the lit sides,
and scans of the lit and dark sides may be made. For the JST
trajectory, Figure 14 shows a scan of Io by several of the spectral
instruments. This scan is planned to occur soon after the Io flux tube
passage. Figure 15 indicates the projected FOV areas that can be
obtained by several instruments during the Ganymede closest approach.

Beyond Jupiter, science measurements will continue to be made.
Continuous S/X-band tracking is planned for navigation and radio
science purposes to encounter plus 10 days. Continuous high-rate
general science data is planned until encounter plus 40 days. Then,
the Jupiter-to-Saturn cruise period will begin, when the science
activities will be similar to those of the Earth-to-Jupiter cruise
period. At Saturn, the science measurements will be similar to those
of Jupiter, but details will vary significantly because of different
trajectory geometry and the lower available data rate. This lower rate
will require the recording of some of the high-rate data for later
playback. Of particular interest at Saturn, of course, are Titan,
which is known to have a substantial atmosphere, and Saturn's rings.
Beyond Saturn, if all goes well, and the Uranus option is exercised,
the Voyager 2 will continue in cruise until it arrives at Uranus in
January, 1986. Observation sequences during the approach and flyby of
Uranus and its satellites would exhibit many similarities to the
earlier planetary encounters for most of the non-imaging science
investigations, but would differ markedly for imaging due to the
reduced data rate capability. Further discussions of this topic are
left to future papers.

7. Concluding Remarks

This paper has summarized the highlights of the Voyager mission design
in order to establish a framework upon which to better understand the
objectives and potential returns from the eleven scientific
investigations which are described in subsequent papers. Selection of
the attractive JST and JSX nominal trajectories permits the
observation of several satellites at close to moderate flyby
distances. The Voyager mission will provide a broad survey of many
bodies whose formation occurred under different conditions than those
of the terrestial planets, thereby extending our knowledge of bodies
within the Solar System. In addition to the many thousands of spectra,
photometric, and thermal data frames, Voyager expects to achieve
imaging resolutions of better than 10 km on portions of as many as
three planets and a dozen satellites. This represents a resolution
improvement between one and three orders-of-magnitude over previous
scientific measurements. We look forward, therefore, with much
excitement to a successful Voyager mission, and can only wonder about
the nature of future missions which may evolve from its discoveries.

TABLE I
Scientific investigations for the Voyager mission

TABLE II
Target Body Selected Physical Characteristics. Values in this table
have been taken from a single reference source, Newburn and Gulkis
(1975), and may not reflect more recent data such as that shown in
parentheses for selected parameters. These physical data are provided
only as a convenient reference of the major parameters for the bodies
of primary interest. No values are given for the temperatures of the
Galilean satellites because of the uncertainties quoted in the
reference. The rotational periods of the satellites assume synchronous
rotation about the primary.

TABLE III
Voyager data modes summary

TABLE IV
Voyager standard trajectory characteristics. This table provides the
launch dates, planet encounter dates, and the major encounter
characteristics for the nominal Voyager JST and JSX trajectories.
Obvious abbreviations have been used for the satellites of Jupiter and
Saturn. For each encounter, only the closest approach distances (from
target center) and times for those satellites are listed for which the
closest approach distance is within 10^6 km. Note than for JSX. the
Jupiter encounter characteristics are identical for both the Titan and
Uranus options. This implies that the option choice need not be made
until after Jupiter encounter. The symbols R[J] and R[S] indicate that
the distance units are in terms of the Jupiter and Saturn radii,
respectively (see Table II). The superscript cross attached to some
Saturn satellite abbreviations indicates that the satellite and/or
spacecraft is in Earth or Sun occultation by the planet at the
satellite closest approach time. For JSX (to Uranus), the Uranus
encounter date is January 30, 1986.

Navigation accuracy capability estimates(1[alpha] Semi-Major Axis,
km). The navigation error shown is that of the largest axis of the
target-relative dispersion ellipsoid.

Fig. 1. Voyager journey to the giant planets. An artists rendering
depicts one of two Voyager spacecraft pointing at Earth for data
return following the Saturn flyby. The use of Jupiter gravity assist
has reduced the launch energy requirements needed to reach Saturn.
Four trajectory correction maneuvers are planned on each planet-to-
planet leg of the journey.

Fig. 2. Jupiter flux tube and wake diagram. The motion of a Galilean
satellite through the Jovian environment can produce such interesting
geometrical regions as a 'flux tube', where the satellite interrupts
the flow of charged particles along the magnetic field lines, and a
'wake' region, which arises from the satellite interference with the
co-rotating planetary plasma.

Fig. 3. Voyager spacecraft. An advanced three-axis attitude stabilized
spacecraft for exploration of the outer planets. Key features include:
radioisotope power, sources. subsystem redundancy, onboard computer
control and fault detection, 3.7 m high-gain antenna with S-hand and
X-band telecommunications, accurate scan platform pointing for remote
sensing, and instruments for conducting eleven different scientific
investigations. Total spacecraft mass is approximately 325 kg, with
total power available of approximately 400 W.

Fig 4. Remote sensing capability of voyager science instruments Insert
shows scan platform optical instruments and thermal blankets.

Fig. 5. Voyager data rate capability envelope f or JSX trajectory.
Several assumptions were employed in calculating the above data rate
performance boundaries. All curves are based upon the appropriate
Voyager transmitter at high power over the high-gain antenna.
Unfavorable performance is at the -1.28[sigma] level (0.9 probability
of performance this good or better) and the dashed curve indicates
conversion of one 26 m DSS subnet to 34 m by 10/1/1980. Performance
oscillations are due to the yearly Earth orbit range effects and
performance for the JST trajectory (not shown) is comparable to or
better than that for JSX particularly at Jupiter encounter. Available
spacecraft discrete data rates have been indicated on the ordinate.

Fig. 6. Voyager heliocentric trajectories. This view from the ecliptic
north pole shows the planetary orbits of Earth through Uranus,
together with the JST and JSX trajectories. Past Saturn, the JST
trajectory rises considerably out of the ecliptic due to the
requirement to encounter Titan before Saturn periapsis passage. The
two options for JSX are shown, with the trajectory remaining close to
the ecliptic if the Uranus option is chosen (X = U), and rising out of
the ecliptic if the Titan encounter is chosen (X = TB). The arrow for
the solar apex points approximately in the direction in which the
solar system is moving relative to the interstellar medium.

Figure 7. JST Jupiter encounter. This view from the planet north pole
shows trajectory closest approach distances to the planet and selected
satellites, satellite periods, and two-hour tick marks along the
trajectory. Note Io flux tube passage at 22 000 km.

Fig. 8. JSX Jupiter encounter. This view from the planet north pole
shows trajectory closest approach distances to the planet and selected
satellites, satellite periods, and two-hour tick marks along the
trajectory. Note close Ganymede encounter at distance of 55 000 km.

Fig. 9. JST Saturn encounter. This view from the planet north pole
shows trajectory closest approach distances to the planet and selected
satellites, satellite periods, and two-hour tick marks along the
trajectory. The Titan emphasis provides a very close Titan encounter
at 7000 km with dual Earth and Sun occultation.

Fig. 10. JSX Saturn encounter (Uranus option). This view from the
planet north pole shows trajectory closest approach distances to the
planet and selected satellites, satellite periods and two-hour tick
marks along the trajectory. Note that several satellite encounters are
provided in addition to a mid-range Titan encounter.

Fig 11. JST at Saturn as viewed from Earth. The path of the JST
trajectory during Earth occultation. as seen from the Earth, is shown
here. The spacecraft enters Earth occultation about two hours after
Saturn encounter near 60 degrees south latitude. Occultation exit
occurs about 1 hour 45 minutes later near the equator and clear of the
rings. After a brief period in the gap, the spacecraft is occulted by
Saturn's rings for about 20 minutes.

Fig. 12. Typical JST Jupiter encounter period science activities. This
figure shows a typical timeline of science activities for the JST
Jupiter encounter period from -80 days to 140 days. The time period
near Jupiter has an expanded scale to show the higher science activity
at encounter.

Fig. 14. South polar scam of Io. Following the Io flux tube passage,
about 3 hours past Jupiter closest approach, spectral instruments will
scan the south polar region of Io. Shown is a UVS and PPS scan lasting
about 8 minutes. The PPS field of view is 0.25 degrees.

Fig. 15. Spectral measurements at Ganymede closest approach. Several
Galilean satellite encounters come within 200 000 km. Shown are the
FOV are projections for IRIS, UVS. and the ISSNA camera (0.424 deg
FOV) for the Ganymede encounter on the JST trajectory.
