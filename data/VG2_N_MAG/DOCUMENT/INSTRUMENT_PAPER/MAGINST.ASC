Abstract. The magnetic field experiment to be carried on the Voyager 1
and 2 missions consists of dual low field (LFM) and high field
magnetometer (HFM) systems. The dual systems provide greater
reliability and, in the case of the LFM's, permit the separation of
spacecraft magnetic fields from the ambient fields. Additional
reliability is achieved through electronics redundancy. The wide
dynamic ranges of +/- 0.5 G for the LFM's and +/- 20 G for the HFM's,
low quantization uncertainty of +/- 0.002 [gamma] ([gamma] = 10^-5 G)
in the most sensitive (+/- 8 [gamma]) LFM range, low sensor RMS noise
level of 0.006 [gamma], and use of data compaction schemes to optimize
the experiment information rate all combine to permit the study of a
broad spectrum of phenomena during the mission. Objectives include the
study of planetary fields at Jupiter, Saturn, and possibly Uranus;
satellites of these planets; solar wind and satellite interactions
with the planetary fields; and the large-scale structure and
microscale characteristics of the interplanetary magnetic field. The
interstellar field may also be measured.

1. Introduction

The investigations of the magnetic fields and magnetospheres of major
planetary systems in the outer Solar System and their interactions
with the solar wind are primary objectives of the space exploration
program to be conducted during the Voyager missions. In addition, the
investigation of interplanetary magnetic field phenomena during the
flights is of fundamental importance both to the understanding of the
magnetospheric observations and to a number of outstanding questions
in basic plasma physics and in the general dynamics of the solar wind.
If the Heliospheric boundary is penetrated, accurate measurement of
the interstellar magnetic field is also an important objective.

A wide dynamic range, with high sensitivity for ultra-low field
measurements, is required to accomplish both the planetary and
interplanetary (and possibly also interstellar) objectives. The
Voyager magnetic field experiment has been designed to provide
precise, accurate and rapid vector measurements of fields ranging from
0.006 [gamma] to 2 x 10^6 [gamma] (20 G). To cover this enormous range
efficiently, the experiment employs both a low field system and a high
field system. The low field system has eight dynamic ranges from +/-
8.8 [gamma] to +/- 50 000  [gamma] with corresponding quantization
uncertainties of +/- 2.2 m[gamma] to +/- 12.2 [gamma]. The measured
sensor noise level is 6 m[gamma] RMS over a bandpass of 0-8.3 Hz. The
basic instrument sampling rate is 162/3 vectors/sec. The high field
system, whose sampling rate is 1 2/3 vectors/sec, has two dynamic
ranges, +/- 0.5 G and +/- 20 G, with quantization uncertainties of +/-
12.2 [gamma] and +/- 488 [gamma] respectively, and a sensor noise
level < 10 [gamma] over a bandpass of 0-1 Hz.

Each 'system' consists of two complete magnetometer experiments; high
reliability is obtained by the use of redundant subsystems and 'cross-
strapping' between systems. The low field magnetometers are located
remotely from the spacecraft on a 13 m boom, with sufficient
separation to permit analytic removal of spacecraft fields from
simultaneous measurements. This dual magnetometer technique, which was
developed for and employed successfully on the Mariner 10 mission, has
been described by Ness et al. (1971).

The major scientific objectives of the Voyager magnetic field
experiment may be summarized as follows:

(1) Measure and analytically represent the planetary magnetic fields
of Jupiter, Saturn, and possibly Uranus. Use these observations to
continue and extend comparative studies of planetary magnetism.

(2) Determine the magnetospheric structure of all planets encountered.
Investigate the basic physical mechanisms and processes involved, both
in solar wind magnetosphere interactions and internal magnetospheric
dynamics, in correlative studies with other particles and fields
experiments.

(3) Investigate the interactions of the satellites of these planets
with their magnetosphere/solar wind environments. Assess the role of
such interactions in observed magnetospheric phenomena and deduce
physical properties of the satellites encountered, especially possible
intrinsic magnetization.

(4) Accurately survey the interplanetary magnetic field beyond 1 AU
and continue and extend studies of the large-scale characteristics of
the interplanetary medium. In particular, the evolution and detailed
properties of solar wind streams and their effects on planetary
magnetospheres will be investigated.

(5) Continue and extend studies of the physics of microscale phenomena
in the solar wind. In particular, studies of the properties of waves,
shocks, and directional discontinuities will be conducted and the
relation between the magnetic field and the propagation of solar and
galactic cosmic rays investigated.

(6) Search for the transition between the interplanetary and
interstellar media, and, if possible, investigate the characteristics
of the boundary region and measure the galactic magnetic field and its
variations.

All of the results will be considered in terms of their significance
for theories of the origin of the Solar System and for their general
applicability to other areas of astrophysics.

The specific objectives are discussed in more detail in Sections 2
through 4, and the experiment instrumentation and data characteristics
are described in detail in Section 5.

2. Jupiter Science Objectives

2.1. MAGNETOSPHERE

One of the most remarkable results of the Pioneer 10 and 11 flyby
missions was the identification of a strongly distorted outer
magnetosphere of the planet Jupiter (Smith et al., 1974, 1975, 1976a).
Nevertheless, the three-dimensional characteristics of the Jovian
magnetosphere are still by no means well understood. The post-Pioneer
picture of magnetospheric structure is in contrast with pre-encounter
expectations and has raised profound questions about the physics of
Jupiter's magnetosphere, particularly with regard to the influence of
the rapid rotation of the massive planet.

The Voyager missions will provide another pair of traverses through
the interesting and important outer magnetospheric region. In this
case, a unique separation of the spatial and temporal variations may
be possible because of the relatively close spacing of the two Voyager
spacecraft, allowing the state of the near-Jupiter interplanetary
medium to be monitored by one spacecraft during the magnetospheric
traverse of the other. Since the inclination of Jupiter's rotational
axis to the ecliptic is only 3 [deg.] and the tilt of its dipole axis
approximately 9.5 [deg.], the wobbling of the solar wind flow
direction relative to a magnetospheric frame of reference is less than
that at Earth. Hence, any significant variation of the magnetospheric
structure observed by the Voyagers, in comparison with earlier
investigations, can be most plausibly interpreted in terms of
different conditions of the magnetosphere and interplanetary medium at
that time rather than any significant difference in flow geometry
relative to the magnetic field source.

From the Pioneer observations, the Jovian magnetosphere has been
interpreted as being a very 'soft', although an enormously large,
obstacle to solar wind flow. This view is based on the wide variation
in the radial distances of the observed multiple bow shock and
magnetopause crossings (Smith et al., 1974, 1975; Wolfe et al., 1974).
This is illustrated in Figure 1 by the Pioneer 11 magnetic field
measurements (Smith et al., 1975). Such large excursions of the bow
shock and magnetopause positions might be a general feature of the
Jovian magnetosphere and may be produced by the interaction with the
steep stream interfaces or shock pairs that are associated with high-
speed solar wind streams at large heliocentric distances (Hundhausen
and Gosling, 1976). Internal dynamical processes may also be involved
in the magnetopause position changes. Correlative observations by the
two Voyager spacecraft should provide additional insight into the
characteristics of these phenomena.

The highly fluctuating fields associated with the microscale physical
processes of the solar wind-outer magnetosphere interaction will be
studied in detail. Such detailed structure is illustrated in Figure 2,
which shows Pioneer 10 total magnetic field measurements during a
three-day period which included a single set of bow shock and
magnetopause crossings. The data will be investigated for evidence of
plasma instabilities in the magnetopause region. The detailed study
will include an analysis of any bow shock-associated waves similar to
those observed at Earth (see reviews by Fairfield, 1976; Greenstadt,
1976) and near Mercury (Fairfield and Behannon, 1976), as well as any
waves that may be observed within the outer magnetosphere.

Voyager 1 and 2 will provide additional observations of the structure
of the Jovian magnetosphere to a closest approach radius of 4.9 R[J].
Beyond 10-12 R[J], the planetary field was found by Pioneers 10 and 11
to be increasingly distorted from a dipole configuration with
increasing distance from the planet. It appears to be extended or
distended by a disc-like plasma distribution which has been discussed
theoretically by Barish and Smith (1975), Goertz (1976), and Gleeson
and Axford (1976). This configuration is similar to the geomagnetic
tail, and beyond approximately 30 R[J] a thin (perhaps 1-2 R[J]
thick), low magnitude (~1 g ) current sheet region exists. The
existence of a tail-like configuration in the region so far explored
(5-12 hr local time) is thought to result from the large centrifugal
force associated with the vast magnetosphere and rapid (10 hour)
planetary rotation rate. This force causes the magnetic field lines to
extend far out near the equatorial plane. At large distances from
Jupiter outward plasma flow along the field lines may be a possible
explanation for the observed spiral field structure. Radiation belt
particle observations during the Pioneer mission suggest the
corotation region to extend out to approximately 25 R[J] (e.g. Trainor
et al., 1974). The Voyager observations will provide further
information on this point. A better understanding of the extent of
'wrapping up' or 'spiraling' of the magnetic field in the outer Jovian
magnetosphere will permit determination of the angular momentum
transfer between the solar wind and Jupiter.

2.2. SATELLITE-MAGNETOMETER INTERACTIONS

The interaction between a satellite and the Jovian magnetosphere
depends on the properties of the satellite and its atmosphere, on the
characteristics of the field and particle environment, and on the
properties of the Jovian ionosphere. Since the Jovian magnetosphere
probably co-rotates with the planet at least to the orbit of Callisto
(e.g., Trainor et al., 1974), the relative velocities between
satellites and plasma are 57, 104, 199, and 333 km sec-1 for Io
through Callisto, respectively. Bow shocks will form in this
interaction if V[rel] > [square root] (V[A]^2 + V[s]^2) (V[A] and V[s]
are the Alfven and sound speeds, respectively), since the relative
velocity is roughly perpendicular to the local magnetic field. Unless
the tentative density measurements from Pioneer (Frank et al., 1976)
are wrong by more than two orders of magnitude, V[rel] << [square
root] (V[A]^2 + V[s]^2) and therefore the speeds of the inner three
Galilean satellites are sub-fast in the MHD sense. It is only for
Callisto that a slight increase in the plasma density and decrease in
proton temperature below the measured value of kT[p]= 400 eV in the
plasma sheet would allow V[rel] ~>= [square root] (V[A]^2+V[s]^2).
Hence we expect no bow shock at Io, Europa, and Ganymede but possibly
at Callisto as it moves through the equatorial plasma sheet.

The origin of the decametric emissions from Jupiter remains an
outstanding problem. These bursts, with a peak near 8 MHz and reaching
into the hectometric region, are probably connected with plasma
instabilities within the Jovian ionosphere (Smith, 1976). The control
of the decametric emissions by Io is most likely exercised by means of
the magnetic flux tube connecting a plasma sheath around Io with
Jupiter's ionosphere. The foot of this tube probably produces or
enhances instabilities in the ionosphere and hence influences the
production of decametric bursts. Various unipolar induction models of
the interaction have been developed by Goldreich and Lynden-Bell
(1969), Gurnett (1972), Webster et al. (1972), Neubauer and Luzemann
(1977) and Shawhan (1976).

The Voyager 2 spacecraft is targeted to traverse the Io fluxtube at a
distance of 25 000 km from Io and thus should provide a definitive
observation of phenomena related to decametric radiation. A diagram of
this traverse, in which a maximum of 4 min 30 sec will be spent in the
fluxtube, is included in the Mission Description. The sketch shows
that the position predicted for the fluxtube depends on the Jupiter
main field model used, i.e., whether it is that of Smith et al.
(1976a) or that of Acuna and Ness (1976b). For the case shown in the
figure, where only the equivalent offset tilted dipole was used, the
difference in predicted position is mainly a shift along the
trajectory path, and hence the probability of intercepting the
fluxtube is model independent. We note in addition that the field-
aligned currents predicted by most models of the Io-magnetosphere
interaction cause a bending of the fluxtube which is particularly
strong near Io. The fluxtube leaves Io tilted away from the
undistorted magnetic field by the angle in the direction of the
orbital motion of Io. A rough estimate of the bending due to field-
aligned currents to and from Jupiter leads to an angle [delta] >> 3
[deg.] x current in million amperes). Careful analysis of the flyby
magnetic field data will enable us to develop a model description of
the current system in the vicinity of Io. For example, a current of
800 000 amperes will lead to a displacement of the flux-tube cross-
section by 30% of one Io diameter at about 25 000 km from the
satellite.

In physical models of the Io-Jovian magnetosphere interaction, the
assumption has tacitly been made that Io has no internal magnetic
field. There is no observational evidence either for or against such
an assumption. However, the rocky satellites Io and Europa should at
least contain certain amounts of magnetizable material. Thus Io could
possibly possess either fields due to a natural remanent
magnetization, a dynamo field, or an induced field. In the
interpretation of the Io flyby data, various models of an internal
magnetic field will be considered.

Another relatively near satellite encounter will be the flyby of
Ganymede, with a targeted closest approach radius of 50 000 km for
Voyager 1. Ganymede is considered second in interest among the
Galilean satellites because of the recent evidence for an atmosphere
which may be composed of oxygen (Yung and McElroy, 1975). Measurements
taken near Ganymede will be studied for evidence of interaction-
related disturbances. As at Io, we shall also look for evidence of an
internal magnetic field.

2.3. MAIN MAGNETIC FIELD

Jupiter was studied by radio astronomical means for almost two decades
before the first direct information on Jupiter's magnetic field was
provided by the Pioneer 10 and 11 flybys in 1973 and 1974. These
spacecraft confirmed many characteristic features of the magnetic
field of Jupiter (Smith et al., 1974, 1975, 1976a; Acuna and Ness,
1976a, b) and established the dipole moment as ~= 1.6 x 10^30 G cm^-3,
tilted ~9.5 [deg.] near the appropriate system III longitude, taking
into account the slight difference between the rotation rate of the
magnetic pole relative to the system III rotation rate (Mead, 1974).

Analyses of magnetic field data obtained close to the planet (i.e., at
distances of less than 6 R[J]) have been conducted in terms of a
classical spherical harmonic expansion of magnetic multipoles. Results
from the two separate Pioneer 11 experiments of Acuna and Ness
(1976a,b) and Smith et al. (1976a) agree with respect to the
significance of the surprisingly large quadrupole and octupole terms.
The closest approach during the Voyager flybys will be at a distance
of 4.9 R[J], and at that distance the main magnetic field is dominated
by the dipole term, with small contributions from magnetic field
sources external to the planet. The latter include the distortion of
the Jovian magnetosphere by planetary rotation, plasma co-rotation and
inflation, and the interaction with the solar wind. It is possible
that a careful comparison of accurate analyses of data from Pioneers
10 and 11 and Voyagers 1 and 2 will provide a data base for studying
any secular change of the Jovian magnetic field.

3. Saturn Science Objectives/Uranus Option

3.1. MAIN FIELD AND MAGNETOSPHERE OF SATURN

Since Saturn is similar to Jupiter in terms of size, rotation period,
low mean density and probable internal heat source, it is reasonable
to infer that Saturn may also have an intrinsic magnetic field and
magnetosphere similar to that of Jupiter. Assuming that the magnetic
dipole moment of a planet is proportional to its angular momentum,
simply scaling from Jupiter results in the prediction of a dipole
moment of approximately 1 x 10^30 G cm^-3 = 4 G R[S]^3 with 9 G polar
surface field.

The first unambiguous evidence for a Saturnian magnetic field has been
found by the IMP-6 observation of non-thermal radio emission near 1
MHz (Brown, 1975). The peak flux density near 1 MHz is nearly equal to
that found for Jupiter at 8 MHz when the difference in distance from
the Earth is taken into account. The frequency difference is most
likely related to a difference in planetary magnetic field strengths.
If linear scaling is appropriate, as would be the case for cyclotron
emission, Saturn's magnetic field would be lower than Jupiter's by a
factor of 8, giving a Saturnian polar field in the range 1-2 G. The
dipole moment would scale as M[S]=(1/8)*(R[S]/R[J])^3*M[J], yielding
M[S] = 1 x 10^29 G cm^-3 or 0.5 G R[S]^3.

The major objective of the magnetic field experiment during the
encounters of the two Voyager spacecraft with Saturn will be the
measurement of the intrinsic Saturnian magnetic field. As in the case
of Jupiter, the Saturnian field will be investigated by determining
the leading coefficients of the spherical harmonic expansion for the
magnetic field. A closest approach distance of 3.3R[S] is targeted for
Saturn (or 2.7R[S] if the Uranus option is exercised). An analysis of
the encounter trajectories for various field models has shown that the
latitude and longitude coverages are great enough for those
trajectories to permit the determination of a quadrupole component and
probably also an octupole component of the planetary field (Thompson
and Ness, 1977).

Many of the objectives for the study of the magnetosphere of Jupiter
are also applicable to Saturn. Although no magnetospheric models exist
for Saturn, with a dipole moment M[S] = 1 x 10^29 G cm^3 perpendicular
to the solar wind and for expected typical solar wind properties at 10
AU, we would expect the stagnation point to be located at a distance
of ~25R[S] with a field magnitude of 7 g just inside the magnetopause
for a magnetosphere of the terrestrial type. For comparison, a
stagnation point distance of ~50R[S] is obtained using the dipole
moment derived from angular momentum scaling. The effects of the rapid
planetary rotation (10-hour period) will be investigated. A much
larger magnetosphere is expected if stretching of field lines due to
centrifugal forces is important. Details of such a magnetosphere
depend on a detailed model for the plasma distribution in the
magnetosphere of Saturn.

3.2. SATELLITE STUDIES

In the same manner as at Jupiter, the effects of satellites on the
magnetosphere will be investigated. In the case of Saturn the major
difference is the absence of a big satellite like Io close to the
planet. Titan is the major satellite targeted for investigation, and
the semimajor axis of its orbit about Saturn is 20 R[S]. If the
Saturnian magnetic field is in fact as strong as is implied by the
non-thermal emission data, then Titan will probably be inside the
magnetosphere of Saturn at least during periods of undisturbed solar
wind conditions. Titan is somewhat larger and more massive than the
Moon, and it has been long known to have a gravitationally-bound
atmosphere. Thus the interaction of Titan with its environment will be
of special significance.

Both spacecraft will encounter Titan prior to Saturn closest approach,
in the sunward part of the Saturnian magnetosphere, with a Titan
closest-approach distance of 7000 km ~= 3R[T]. The trajectories will
traverse both the expected nominal position of a 'wake' produced by
corotation of the Saturnian magnetosphere and the solar occultation
shadow region (see the Titan encounter diagram in the Mission
Description). The former will provide the most significant magnetic
field measurements for investigation of the interaction of Titan with
Saturn's magnetosphere. In the event that Saturn has a significantly
weaker magnetic field than is now expected, or if the magnetopause is
temporarily closer to the planet in response to an increased solar
wind ram pressure, the latter traversal will permit measurements of
Titan's wake in the solar wind. The nature of the wake observed in
either case should make it possible to infer at least an upper limit
for an intrinsic magnetic field of Titan. It may also be possible to
detect a bow shock wave upstream of Titan if one exists.

It is doubtful whether any significant magnetic effects will be
observed during any of the other Saturnian satellite flybys due to the
small sizes of the satellites, the greater encounter distances and
generally less favorable encounter phases.

3.3. URANUS OBJECTIVES

The option to reprogram Voyager 1 inflight for a Uranus encounter has
been discussed in the Mission Description. This possibility is of
particular interest to magnetic field investigators because of the
recent indication that Uranus also may have a strong magnetic field.
Brown (1976) has reported the detection by IMP-6 of radio bursts from
the direction of Uranus. These emissions are similar to those
originating from Jupiter and Saturn, but the observations are
ambiguous because of the unfavorable angular separation of Earth and
Uranus during the observing period. The uniqueness of the events
suggests that the source is not terrestrial, however. The observed
events were strongest in intensity near 0.5 MHz. The spectral behavior
was similar to that of emissions from Jupiter and Saturn except for a
smaller bandwidth. With linear scaling, the polar field for Uranus
would be less than that inferred for Saturn by a factor of 2 and thus
16 times lower in magnitude than that of Jupiter. The magnetic moment
would scale as M[U]=(1/16)*(R[U]/R[J])^3*M[J], yielding M[U] = 3 x
10^27 G cm^-3 or 0.2 G R[U]^3.

The main objective at Uranus would be the determination of the
planetary magnetic field. Uranus is distinctive among the planets in
that its axis of rotation lies very nearly in the ecliptic plane. This
orientation of the rotation axis together with the rapid rotation (~11
hour period) and the spacecraft flyby speed and path will yield
excellent longitude and latitude coverage. This is very favorable for
the determination of a reasonable set of low order spherical harmonic
coefficients to describe the internal magnetic field.

Prior to the existence of any observational evidence for a magnetic
field at Uranus, models of a possible Uranian magnetosphere were
constructed by Siscoe (1975) as a function of dipole moment MU for 2 x
10^-3 M[E]<=M[U]<=M[J], where M[E] = Earth's magnetic moment. If the
magnetic moment inferred from the observations of Brown (1976) is
correct, the models predict that the magnetosphere encloses the orbit
of the outermost satellite, Oberon.

Although there are uncertainties in boundary conditions and thus a
large number of possibilities for any Uranian magnetosphere, the
unique orientation of the Uranian rotation axis makes such a
magnetosphere extremely interesting in comparison with other
magnetospheres. It is likely that its magnetic dipole axis is aligned
close to its rotation axis as is the case for Earth and Jupiter. In
the present 84 year orbit of Uranus about the Sun, the rotational axis
and therefore probably also approximately the dipole axis will be
aligned roughly along the Uranus-Sun line in 1985. Thus the dipole
axis should be within 10 [deg.] of this unique alignment at the time
of flyby by the Voyager 1 spacecraft flying the Uranus option,
offering the opportunity to probe a 'pole-on' magnetosphere when the
pole is close to Sunward orientation.

For such a configuration the magnetosphere should be characterized by
steady magnetospheric convection because the geometric conditions for
reconnection taking place at the magnetopause are essentially always
fulfilled. Since reconnection is one of the important basic processes
in space plasma physics, the study of this magnetosphere would be an
important objective of the magnetic field experiment at Uranus. Inside
the magnetosphere, the rapid rotation of the planet combined with the
solar wind-induced convection will lead to strongly distorted field
lines. The solar wind conditions determining the convection picture
will have been observed shortly before encounter.

The low interplanetary fields expected at Uranus mean that the
electron gyrofrequency in the region just upstream from the planet
(2.8 Hz in a 0.1 g field) will fall well within the bandpass (Nyquist
frequency) of the instrument in the encounter mode. In the event of a
planetary bow shock, not only can the types of lower-frequency
upstream wave associated with other planetary bow shocks be studied
but other types of waves nearer the electron gyrofrequency also can be
investigated.

4. Interplanetary Magnetic Field Observations

The Voyager missions provide an opportunity to study magnetic fields
in a 'collisionless', plasma on a wide astronomical scale (to a
distance of at least 10 AU and possibly to 20 AU and beyond). In
contrast with the approximately one year launch separation of Pioneers
10 and 11, the two Voyager flights will be launched less than one
month apart. This will provide a unique opportunity to study the
general evolution, including propagation and dissipation
characteristics, of waves, discontinuities, shocks and large-scale
stream-related features of the interplanetary magnetic field in a way
unmatched by previous missions.

Perhaps the most interesting large-scale feature that might be
observed is the transition between the interplanetary magnetic field
and the interstellar magnetic field. The best current estimate is that
this occurs by means of a shock at 50 AU (Axford, 1973), which is well
beyond the limits of the Voyager missions, but the estimate of 50 AU
could be in error by a factor of 2. Hence the possibility exists that
the Voyager spacecraft will traverse the transition region and even
measure the galactic magnetic field and its variations. Since the
average galactic field in the region sampled might be less than 0.1
[gamma] (Vershuur, 1968; Bok, 1970), it is important to be able to
measure fields of this strength and weaker.

Large time variations in the solar wind and interplanetary field
parameters are continuous features of the interplanetary medium and
are of primary importance to the dynamical behavior of planetary
magnetospheres as well as to interplanetary dynamical processes. The
principle variations in energy density of the magnetic field near 1 AU
are related to 'corotating' streams of high speed solar plasma. Such
streams often steepen to form shock pairs beyond 1 AU (Smith and
Wolfe, 1976; Hundhausen and Gosling, 1976; Gosling et al., 1976).

Flare-associated streams preceded by a shock (Hundhausen, 1972;
Burlaga, 1975) or a shock pair (Ipavich and Lepping, 1975) are
observed near 1 AU and have been observed beyond 1 AU by Pioneer 10
(Smith et al., 1976b). An important complication in the distant solar
wind is the interaction of flare- associated streams with corotating
streams. The study of both types of streams and shocks as they occur,
and their evolution through successive interactions, will be
facilitated by the dual-spacecraft observational capability of the
Voyager missions.

The microscale properties of the magnetic field are of fundamental
importance to a number of basic processes in the solar wind such as
heat transport, wave propagation and the motion of energetic solar
particles and galactic cosmic rays throughout the solar system. The
Voyager magnetic field experiment is designed to permit detailed
studies of microstructure in the distant interplanetary and even
intergalactic fields (see Section 5), and such studies will be carried
out in close collaboration with plasma and energetic particles
investigators. Among the phenomena to be investigated are the origin,
growth, motion and dissipation of MHD and plasma waves, magnetic field
annihilation and reconnection, discontinuities, interactions between
magnetic fields and energetic particles, effects of the field on the
proton and electron distribution functions of the plasma, and the
general properties of a 'collisionless', neutral hydrogen-plasma
mixture and a magnetic field.

5. Instrument Description

5.1. GENERAL CONFIGURATION

The NASA-GSFC magnetic field experiment on Voyagers 1 and 2 consists
of two magnetometer systems: the high field magnetometer (HFM) and the
low field magnetometer (LFM). Each system contains two identical
triaxial fluxgate magnetometers which measure the magnetic field
intensity along three mutually orthogonal axes simultaneously. The
instruments represent the latest stage in the continuous program of
magnetometer development within our laboratory. The choice of fluxgate
magnetometers is based upon more than 13 years of highly satisfactory
experience with such detectors within this group. They provide
accurate direct vector measurements of ambient magnetic fields while
requiring minimum electronic circuitry, weight and power.

Both high and low field magnetometer sensors utilize a ring core
geometry and thus have lower drive power requirements and better zero
level stability than other types of fluxgates and are smaller in size
(Acuna, 1974). The cores consist of an advanced molybdenum alloy,
especially developed in cooperation with the Naval Surface Weapons
Center, White Oak, Maryland, which exhibits extremely low noise and
high stability characteristics. The use of this alloy and the ring
core sensor geometry thus allows the realization of compact, low
power, ultrastable fluxgate sensors with a noise performance that is
improved almost an order of magnitude over the best previously flown
fluxgate sensors. The HFM's use specially processed miniature ring
cores (1 cm diameter) which minimize the power required to measure
large fields.

One LFM is located at the outboard end of the magnetometer boom and
the other is mounted inboard at approximately 0.57 the distance from
the boom-spacecraft interface to the outboard LFM. The total
interface-to-tip boom length is 13 meters. The two HFM's are located
approximately one meter apart along the boom support truss. The remote
location of the LFM's reduces magnetic contamination from the
spacecraft. The experiment is shown in Figure 3. The total weight,
sensors plus electronics, is 5.6 kg and the power required is 2.2 W.

5.2. DUAL MAGNETOMETER CONCEPT

The dual magnetometer configuration, developed by Ness et al. (1971)
for the Mariner 10 mission and conceptually generalized by Neubauer
(1975), permits analytic separation of the spacecraft field from the
ambient field. In application of the dual magnetometer concept, it is
assumed that, to a good approximation, the magnetic field of the
spacecraft is a spacecraft-centered dipole field as measured at the
remote location of the magnetometer sensors. The spacecraft field at
the position of the outer magnetometer is estimated using

              est
     [vector-B](r[2]) = [alpha] *
              sc
                  ([vector-B][obs](r[1])-[vector-B][obs](r[2]))
                  ---------------------------------------------
                                  1 - [alpha]
[see EQ5_2.GIF]

where [vector-B][obs](r[i]) is the measured field at r[i], i = 1 or 2
representing inner or outer position respectively, and where the
coupling coefficient [alpha] is in this case given by [alpha]
=(r[1]/r[2])^3. This analytically determined vector spacecraft field
at r[2] is then subtracted from the outboard magnetometer
measurements, yielding an estimate of the ambient magnetic field. This
method thus permits the removal from the measurements of the effects
of a significant and variable spacecraft field on a continuous basis
throughout the mission. The spacecraft field at r[2] is expected to be
approximately 0.2 [gamma].

5.3. SENSOR ALIGNMENT CALIBRATION

The 13-meter magnetometer Astromast booms have proved in extensive
pre-flight testing to be highly rigid with respect to bending motions
but 'soft' to torsional or twisting motion. Deployment repeatability
tests have shown as much as +/- 7 [deg.] uncertainty in knowledge of
the boom 'twist' angle (about the boom axis) at the magnetometer
sensor positions, compared with approximately +/- 0.5 [deg.]
uncertainty in bend angles (rotation about axes orthogonal to the boom
axis). In order to minimize sensor alignment uncertainties, a method
to estimate an angular correction matrix was developed that eliminates
most of the twist uncertainty and some of the bend uncertainty.

A special calibration coil has been wound around the periphery of the
spacecraft's high gain antenna to generate, upon command, a known
magnetic field at both LFM magnetometer sensors. The difference
between measurements taken when the coil is turned on and off is the
coil field, independent of all external fields. Using a 20 turn coil
of 1/2 amp yields nominal field intensities of 33.4 and 6.1 [gamma] at
the inboard and outboard sensors, respectively.

An angular correction matrix cannot be uniquely determined from data
obtained through the use of a single reference coil. Thus, the method
that has been developed estimates an angular correction matrix which
optimally corrects for misalignment. This is possible because (1) in
the rotation corrections the small-angle approximation is permitted,
eliminating the usual problem of incommutability of rotations, and (2)
the twist angle is known to strongly dominate the uncertainty. With
such a scheme the angular correction matrix takes the following form:

                  (    1      -[epsilon]      0   )
                  (                               )
     [matrix-M] = ([epsilon]       1      -[delta])
                  (                               )
                  (    0        [delta]       1   )
[see EQ5_3a.GIF]

where

                    ([DELTA]B[X]^M - [DELTA]B[X]^T)
     [epsilon] ~= 2*(-----------------------------)
                    ([DELTA]B[Y]^M + [DELTA]B[Y]^T)

[see EQ5_3b.GIF]

is the twist angle, and


                  ([DELTA]B[Z]^M - [DELTA]B[Z]^T)
     [delta] ~= 2*(-----------------------------)
                  ([DELTA]B[Y]^M + [DELTA]B[Y]^T)

[see EQ5_3c.GIF]

is one of the bend angles.

The superscripts M and T represent inflight measured and theoretically
determined coil fields, [Z-hat] is aligned with the boom axis, [X-hat]
and [Y-hat] are orthogonal to [Z-hat] and to each other but otherwise
arbitrary; the second bend angle is set equal to zero. Simulation
studies have shown that application of this additional calibration
procedure reduces the twist uncertainty to +/- 0.25 [deg.] (including
quantization uncertainty of the instrument) and the bend uncertainty
to less than +/- 0.5 [deg.].

5.4. REDUNDANT ELECTRONICS

The experiment electronics instrumentation consists of the fluxgate
magnetometer electronics and associated controls, and the calibration
and data processing electronics. The electronics block diagram is
shown in Figure 4. Complete redundancy is provided for the analog to
digital converters, data and status readout buffers, command decoders
and power converters. Thus not only can the two magnetometers of a
system be interchanged, but considerable cross-strapping within the
electronics permits interchange of critical internal functions as
well. This design significantly reduces the impact of single-component
failure on the ability of the experiment to continue successful
operation during the mission duration of >=4 years.

5.5. MEASUREMENT RANGE AND ACCURACY

To meet the scientific objectives of the investigation, a wide total
dynamic range of +/- 20 G was selected, together with 12-bit digital
resolution. The LFM's cover the range +/- 0.5 G and the HFM's extend
the experiment range to +/- 20 G. To optimize sensitivity at low field
values, the total LFM range was divided into eight dynamic ranges and
the total HFM range into two dynamic ranges. The individual ranges and
associated quantization uncertainties are given in Table I. These
dynamic ranges will be switched automatically whenever the combined
ambient field plus fluctuations exceeds a predetermined level. The
automatic range switching strategy is shown schematically in Figure 5.
Automatic range switching can be overridden by ground command.

The extremely low digitization uncertainty in the lowest LFM range
will permit the precise and accurate measurement of the very weak
fields expected in the distant solar wind and also the interstellar
fields beyond the heliospheric boundary. The achievement of these
goals will be limited only by zero offset uncertainty and the
intrinsic noise levels of the sensors themselves and the accuracy of
the spacecraft field correction procedures. The Voyager sensor zero
offset variations have been found to be less than +/- 0.2 [gamma] over
the temperature range of -60 [deg.] C to +60 [deg.] C.

The incorporation of both mechanical and electrical 'flippers' into
the experiment will permit the correction for any offsets that might
occur during the mission to an accuracy of +/- 0.05 [gamma]. Each LFM
is equipped with an electrothermally-controlled spring mechanism to
rotate the sensors for inflight sensor offset determination. In
addition, each LFM is equipped with an electrical flipper to reverse
sensor signal polarity for inflight electrical zero offset
determination. In the latter case, the offsets detected would be those
due to radiation effects, component aging, and temperature and voltage
variations, but not those due to changes in the magnetic properties of
the materials used in the sensors. During extensive sensor testing,
zero drifts due to changes in magnetic properties have been found to
be less than 0.1 [gamma] over a 1/2 year period. The sensitivity of
each magnetometer is checked periodically by the generation of
precisely calibrated fields by coils carrying accurately known
currents.

A typical sensor noise level is 0.006 [gamma] RMS over a 8.3 Hz
bandwidth; this performance is illustrated in Figure 6. Figure 6(a)
shows the response of the instrument to inputs of 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125,
and 0.062  [gamma], while Figure 6(b) shows the response to a 0.1 g p-
p sinewave signal. Noise spectrum tests have shown that the noise
amplitude decreases rapidly with increasing frequency (see Figure 7).

In addition to the use of multiple magnetometers and sensor 'flipping'
to enhance the accuracy of the measurements, further calibration
checks will be provided by occasional spacecraft roll maneuvers and by
use of a minimum variance technique initially discussed by Davis and
Smith (1968) and further developed by Belcher (1973) and Hedgecock
(1975). Based on a maximized error analysis, it is estimated
conservatively that absolute accuracies of ~=0.09 [gamma] are
achievable with the Voyager experiment. Of course, changes in the
field which are much smaller than 0.09 [gamma] can be detected, since
their observation is limited only by the quantization step size (0.004
[gamma] in the most sensitive range) and the RMS noise level of the
sensors (0.006 [gamma]). This is important for studies of very low
amplitude waves.

5.6. DATA MODES AND ONBOARD PROCESSING

The data handling scheme is an important feature of this experiment,
because the telemetry bandwidth available to the experiment will be
reduced each time the spacecraft telemetry rate is reduced at
distances from the Sun of typically 2.6, 3.3, 5.0, 7.0 and 9.0 AU. At
encounters, the bandwidth available to science will be increased to
permit intensive study of detailed phenomena at the planets. The
schedule of successive reductions in telemetry bandwidth available to
the experiment with increasing heliocentric distance during cruise
requires an adaptive onboard data processing scheme that maintains a
high rate of information transfer while providing the required
reduction in the data transmission rate.

In order to accomplish these objectives, the experiment data system
was designed to produce either direct readout, time averaging, 6-bit
differencing or adaptive 2-bit delta modulation (DM) of the data. The
onboard data processing that is done within the experiment hardware
itself consists primarily of the storing, formating and shifting of
data to the spacecraft Flight Data Subsystem (FDS), as well as command
decoding and other housekeeping. All higher level data processing
(averaging, differencing and DM) is performed for the experiment by
the FDS.

The selection of data mode depends on available bandwidth, going to
increasingly more dense data compaction up to reductions of
approximately 6 to 1 as the bandwidth is reduced. The various modes
and their associated data rates are shown in detail in Table II. In
the table, P and S designate the LFM 'primary' and 'secondary'
systems, respectively. System P could be associated with either the
inner or the outer LFM sensor, but for the nominal experiment it
designates the outboard sensor and S the inner.

The basic measurement sampling rate of the LFM's in all modes is 16
2/3 vector samples/sec. In the straight averaging mode only simple
averaging of measurements is used for data compaction. In general,
there are N[P] and N[S] points per average for systems P and S,
respectively. This mode is the most conservative, as measured by
WPS[TOTAL] = WPS[P] + WPS[S], where WPS is the rate of vector (3
component) words (measurement or averaged measured points) per second.
In the 6-bit differencing mode, 6-bit differences of averages and less
frequently full 12-bit reference averages are telemetered to ground.
The ratios of the number of 6-bit to reference words for a given
submode are given by K[P] and K[S]. The reference words are redundant
under ideal conditions except for initialization purposes, but in
general they will be used to correct for possible 6-bit saturation or
other possible telemetry errors.

The adaptive 2-bit delta modulation mode is a very robust and
'efficient' data compaction scheme, yielding a broad band of
information for the low bit rates available at the greatest
heliocentric distances. The DM system used in the Voyager experiment
is an improved version of systems flown successfully in the
experiments on Explorers 47 and 50 and Mariner 10. All are 2-step
predictor-corrector devices (Moyer, 1968). The DM mode is analogous to
the 6-bit differencing mode, except that the 6-bit difference of
averages is replaced with 2-bit delta modulation of averages. For each
case in each mode in Table II, the WPS values indicate the effective
information rate for that case, after reconstruction on the ground of
the measurement averages.

In the cruise mode, only the LFM's will be operated, whereas both LFM
and HFM systems will be in operation during planetary and satellite
encounters. For the HFM's the basic sampling rate is 1 2/3
vectors/sec, the telemetry rate is 120 BPS equally divided between
inboard and outboard measurements, and WPS = 1.67 for each.

Appropriate housekeeping parameters such as data mode, instrument
range, critical temperatures and voltages are monitored periodically
and read out into the telemetry stream at a low bit rate. Changes in
the experiment's mode of operation are implemented in synchronization
with such readouts.

6. Summary

The magnetic field experiment will provide precise and accurate
measurements of magnetic fields in the outer solar system and possibly
also in the interstellar medium during the Voyager missions. The wide
dynamic ranges of the magnetometer systems (+/- 0.5 G for the LFM's,
+/- 20 G for the HFM's) will insure that the objectives of measuring
the planetary fields of Jupiter, Saturn, and possibly Uranus are met.
On the basis of past direct measurement at Jupiter and an inferred
Saturnian field, maximum fields expected to be observed along the
trajectories at Jupiter and Saturn are approximately 0.036 G (3600
[gamma]) and 0.027 G (2700 [gamma]), respectively. Both are well
within the LFM total dynamic range. However, the forty-fold increase
in HFM range over that of the LFM's allows for the fact that the
fields at Saturn and Uranus have never been directly measured and
could be much larger than expected. Also there is the possibility that
nominal trajectories will not be flown.

Other major objectives of this mission are: to study the interactions
of the solar wind with planetary fields; to investigate the
interactions of satellites with planetary fields and perhaps with the
solar wind in some cases; to search for evidence of internal satellite
fields when near-encounters with satellites are achieved; and to study
the large-scale structure of the interplanetary magnetic field and the
physics of interplanetary microscale phenomena. To achieve these
objectives, particularly those in which the physics of such processes
as merging, reconnection, plasma instabilities, plasma sheets, and
current systems are to be studied in detail, the LFM design permits
absolute accuracies to < 0.1 [gamma] to be attained and field changes
> 0.006 [gamma] to be directly observed.

The experiment data system has been designed to continue providing a
relatively high effective information rate even as the telemetry
bandwidth is reduced at large distances from the sun through use of
increasingly efficient data compaction modes. The effective rate
varies from the full basic LFM sampling rate of 16 2/3 vectors/sec
near 1 AU and at encounters (primary LFM, reconstructed from 6-bit
differences) to a minimum of 0.5 vectors/sec (primary LFM,
reconstructed from 2-bit DM words) at heliocentric distances of 10 AU
and greater.

To insure long term reliability on a mission lasting >=4 years, the
instrument design includes both dual magnetometer systems and
redundancy of all critical internal functions. In addition, the dual
LFM configuration permits removal of the magnetic field of the
spacecraft (expected to be <=0.2 [gamma] at the outboard LFM) from the
measurements throughout the mission.

In addition to their fundamentally important direct contributions, the
magnetic field measurements will complement the Voyager plasma and
energetic particle measurements and radio astronomy observations, both
in the vicinity of the planets and in interplanetary space.

Fig. 1. Pioneer 11 one-hour averages of magnetic field magnitude
(Smith et al., 1975) inbound at Jupiter, illustrating multiple bow
shock and  magnetopause crossings over a period of five days and a
distance range of 32R[J].

Fig. 2. Detailed measurements of magnetic field magnitude by Pioneer
10 inbound, showing the complex field structure in the region of
interaction between the solar wind and the outer Jovian magnetosphere.
A distinct pre-shock region of fluctuating fields was observed,
followed by a stronger by highly variable field in the sheath region.
A 'turbulent' region just inside the magnetopause was found to be an
additional feature of this complex interaction. Investigation of the
physics of such regions are among the objectives for Voyager
spacecraft encounters with Jupiter. Similar detailed interaction
studies will be conducted at Saturn and possibly Uranus.

Fig. 3. Flight hardware for one voyager spacecraft. At the top are the
bus-mounted analog (left) and digital (right) electronics subchassis.
At the lower left are shown the two High Field Magnetometers, with the
two Low Field Magnetometers at the lower right. One of each type of
magnetometer is shown enclosed in its flight canister with attached
RHU (radioactive heating unit) housing. Note the mechanical flipper
assembly on the LFM at the right.

Fig. 4. Block diagram of the magnetic field experiment. System A
consists of the inboard (IB) LFM and HFM systems and system B includes
the outboard  (OB) LFM and HFM systems, along with their respective
data processors. The cross-strapping that exists between magnetometers
and data processors is shown.

Fig. 5. Illustration of a portion of the total magnetometer automatic
range switching strategy. For operation within a given range, when the
detected field strength exceeds the lower bound of the upper guardband
(1792 engineering units or counts), automatic switching down to the
next less sensitive range occurs. Similarly, a measurement that is
lower than the  upper bound on the lower guardband (256 counts)
automatically initiates a switch up to the next more sensitive range.

Fig. 7. Power spectrum of sensor noise data from tests performed in a
cryogenic shield. The spectral shape is primarily due to the noise 
characteristics of the sensor and sensor electronics. The spectral
density equivalent of an rms noise level of 0.006 [gamma] is 4.3 x 10-
6  [gamma] 2 Hz-1. This can be compared with the quantization noise
levels of 1.9 x 10-7 [gamma] 2 Hz-1 in the +/- 8.8 [gamma] range and
1.6 x 10-6 [gamma] 2 Hz-1 in the +/- 26 [gamma] range.
